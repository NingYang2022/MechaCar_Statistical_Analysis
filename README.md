### <font color=#6495D>Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?</font>

The **Vehicle Length** and **Ground Clearence** had a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to our results, **Vehicle Length** and **Ground Clearence** (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the **Vehicle Length** and **Ground Clearence** have a significant impact on mpg values.

### <font color=#6495D>Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?</font>




### <font color=#6495D>Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?</font>
